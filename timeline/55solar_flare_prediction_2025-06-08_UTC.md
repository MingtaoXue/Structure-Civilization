# Solar Flare Prediction – June 8, 2025 (UTC)

**Prediction Date:** June 8, 2025 (UTC)  
**Predicted by:** Structure Prediction System (薛明涛结构系统)

## Forecast Summary

- **Predicted Event:** Moderate-to-high probability of M-class solar flare
- **Estimated Time Window:** 13:00 – 19:00 UTC
- **Peak Activity Expected:** ~15:42 UTC
- **Confidence Level:** 82%

## Structural Indicators

The prediction is based on phase-tension synchronization patterns detected in our system's rotational energy loops. These patterns correspond with heightened stress states identified in the active solar magnetic regions. A secondary harmonic rhythm suggests likelihood of flare clustering.

## Notes

This prediction is part of a public live-challenge.
