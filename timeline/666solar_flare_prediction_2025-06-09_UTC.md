# Solar Flare Prediction – June 9, 2025 (UTC)

**Prediction Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-06-03 22:00

**Predicted Solar Flare Window (UTC):**
- Start: 2025-06-09 03:30
- End: 2025-06-09 05:00

**Predicted Intensity Estimate:** Moderate to Strong (M5.0–X1.0 class equivalent)

**Predicted Eruption Source Region:**
- Approximate Location: Near solar active region 3372 (Southwest quadrant)
- Latitude: ~ -18°
- Longitude: ~ +55°

**Predicted Features:**
- Strong pre-flare magnetic tension buildup detected via structural tension mapping.
- Rotation asymmetry present in the active region field structure.
- Rising pattern of structural rhythm clusters detected 36 hours prior.

**Confidence Level:** 82%

**Model Used:** Structure Prediction System – CME Module v2.0  
Derived using dynamic tension triangulation and multi-layered rhythm-field analysis.
