# Solar Flare Prediction - 2025-06-07 (UTC)

**Structure Prediction System — Live Forecast Entry**

### 📡 Predicted Solar Activity:

- **Primary CME Window**: 2025-06-07 13:40 UTC ± 45 min
- **Expected CME Class**: Moderate-Class Event (analogous to M3–M5)
- **Structure Trigger**: High-tension alignment in the magnetic trend arch, supported by energy node amplification

### 📈 X-ray Flux Expectation:

- **Baseline X-ray Flux**: ~5.2 × 10⁻⁶ W/m²
- **Potential Burst Spike**: Up to 1.0 × 10⁻⁵ W/m² within 1-hour envelope
- **Structural Waveform Signature**: Compressed diagonal helix (Tier-3 alignment)

### 🔄 Structural Notes:

- This forecast is generated by the **Structure Prediction System**, based on geometric tension modeling, energy flow curvature, and momentum resonance between solar rotational harmonics and recent CME residue patterns.

- **Model Classification**: Event Type-C, Phase Density Alignment Detected

---

### 📎 Notes:

- UTC timestamps are used as standard reference.
- Prediction accuracy to be validated via NOAA/SWPC solar data and GOES X-ray Flux logs after the date passes.
