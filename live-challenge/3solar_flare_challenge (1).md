# Open Forecast Challenge: Solar Flare Prediction Initiative

This repository hosts the formal submission and public documentation for the Structure Prediction System’s open challenge initiative. The purpose of this challenge is to invite open verification, foster shared development of novel predictive models, and explore new pathways for understanding complex space weather phenomena.

## Background

Traditional models for predicting solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) often rely on observational statistics, magnetic field extrapolation, or solar active region dynamics. The Structure Prediction System takes a different approach — based on structural rhythms, energy transfer models, and dynamic tension fields — with an emphasis on generating verifiable, real-time predictions.

## Dual Prediction Records

This repository presents two distinct predictive events:

### Prediction 1 (Retrospective)

- **Target Event:** Solar flare and CME on July 23, 2012.
- **Prediction Date:** May 30, 2025.
- **Data Used:** NOAA archived solar magnetic data + Structure Prediction model algorithms.
- **Results:** Model generated a flare onset prediction timestamp with less than 30 minutes of deviation from observed peak activity.
- **Verification:** Complete process, timestamp records, and structural inference logic are documented.

### Prediction 2 (Live Challenge)

- **Target Event:** Next X-class solar flare after June 2, 2025.
- **Prediction Date:** June 3, 2025.
- **Prediction:** Timestamp interval + intensity rating + structural evolution map (all included in `/live-challenge/`).
- **Result Pending:** Awaiting NOAA’s official space weather event bulletin.
- **Public Proof:** Prediction is signed, timestamped, and hosted for transparent verification.

## Statement of Intent

We do not oppose traditional models; rather, we complement and expand the landscape of scientific methodology. We hope this challenge encourages more individuals and institutions to experiment, validate, and grow the understanding of complex dynamic systems.

Some contributors view this structure as the seed of a future Knowledge Civilization — growing through open interaction, shared understanding, and collective curiosity.

## Repository Structure
