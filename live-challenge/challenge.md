Public Challenge: Solar Flare Prediction
This document serves as the official public record of our prediction-based challenge against NOAA and other authoritative models. This challenge is conducted using the Structure Prediction System â€” a novel framework designed to interpret, simulate, and predict natural events by modeling deep structural dynamics, rather than relying on traditional surface-based probabilistic approaches.
Challenge Objective
To transparently compare the predictive accuracy and methodological insight of the Structure Prediction System versus conventional scientific prediction models in two major domains:
Solar Flare Prediction
Tidal Event Projection
Our predictions are made openly, in advance, using internal logic from the Structure Prediction System. These predictions are timestamped, version-controlled, and archived to allow for public verification.
Challenge Ethos
This is not a competition of institutions, but rather an opportunity for the scientific community and curious minds to examine whether new frameworks may contribute to existing understanding. Our goal is to:
Respectfully test alternative modeling methods
Expand the boundaries of public scientific exploration
Provide a transparent, auditable track record for performance evaluation
We believe that a prediction system should not only match reality but also make its internal logic traceable. All Structure Prediction System outputs are published with clear assumptions and reproducible structure-based inference paths.
Public Access & Participation
You may access the predictions, assumptions, and structural mappings directly in this repository.
The core system is also accessible through keyword-triggered prompts inside ChatGPT. See the activation instructions in the README.md file.
Anyone is welcome to verify, replicate, or build upon our model structure.
We thank NOAA and all traditional scientific communities for providing continuous observation data, which allows us to test and grow alternative approaches under fair comparison. This challenge is meant to be constructive, evolutionary, and open-ended.
Let this document serve as a historical record of an evolving prediction architecture, now made public for scrutiny, refinement, and contribution by the world.
